# GTK3 Crystal Bindings

This is a fork of [hugopl/gtk4.cr](https://github.com/hugopl/gtk4.cr), but with GTK3. Please see that other repo for details.

There's also [jhass/crystal-gobject](https://github.com/jhass/crystal-gobject) for GTK3 which is much more battle-tested. Both bindings are not compatible, but migrating is not hard.
